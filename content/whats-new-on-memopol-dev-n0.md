Hello everyone, this is the beginning of a series of development diaries
to report on the progress of our project!

**Latest improvements:**  
As part of the latest improvements we have:

A great patch by new contributors: [emel]() and
[benoitb](http://marmelune.net). They have managed to reduce the
incredibly high number of queries on every page where we list european
deputies.

Now eurpdeputies' score is displayed in the listings, so you'll see in a
quick look how net-neutrality friendly your deputy is.  
*See, notes are colorized from red to green depending on the value of
the score :*

And we can make .csv exports ! Which is great, if you want to download
the data and have it in your favourite spreadsheets editor. This can
help to prepare talks, or to play with the data a bit.  
*See (it's on the top right of every list) :*

Another important piece of news: the whole European Parliament website
has changed. This is both good and bad news.

Good news, because this new version offers some new information and is
better overall.

Bad news, we have less data now, especially the previous commitment of a
deputy in a commitee, delegation or mandate, and the starting date of
the current commitment.

**Upcoming:**

News about the design ! We're working on it :)
