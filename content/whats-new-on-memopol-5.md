Hello there !

We did a lot these days for Memopol !

Spreading Memopol anywhere
--------------------------

First, we did some work in order to let you use Memopol for any other
cause! We believe this tool is awesome, so we want to spread it! Image
if you could go on the political memory of every citizen groups that
represents your interests and have an accurate idea on how well your
representatives are effectivly representing you?

It is now possible to personalize Memopol for your own project →

Speaking about updating Memopol we are proud to announce you that now,
Memopol is up to date concerning the French deputies data \\o/  
  
Thanks to [Tarnefys](https://twitter.com/tarNeFyS) for that!

QCC, Day 1
----------

As you probably already know, Memopol team is here at the
[QCC](http://www.laquadrature.net/wiki/Quadrature_Communication_Camp) to
improve Memopol.

We are working on new features for the tool, like trophees that we could
put on the profiles of the MEPs : if they have voted a lot for Net
Neutrality, for example.

We also have --which is great-- a little design team that made already
some work for Memopol. Maybe we'll have a brand new design to present
you after the weekend!  
  
Thanks to quota\_atypique, ybon, cocodaemon for their work \\o/

We'll come back to you tomorrow and tell you what was done today!
