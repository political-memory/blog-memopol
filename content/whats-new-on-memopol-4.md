Hello!

Like you, Memopol is back from holidays! Let's come back to work happily
with some news of our beloved project.

More and more data
------------------

What occured this summer? Ah, ACTA. We enjoyed the victory importing the
data of the votes about the treaty. You can see them here →

We are also working on merging memopol1 opinion's code with the new one.

An easier and faster tool
-------------------------

We did a lot of queries optimization, memopol is now way faster than
before. Also we have made some internal code refactoring for a better
organisation. (Thanks to the coders \\o/) We are happy to welcome new
contributors !

There is also a new clean tool to remove added data from LQDN to make
Memopol clean for another citizen groups : this will be useful, because
we want our tool to be used and reused by others. Good idead have to be
spread everywhere :)

On the UX and design side, we are proud to announce we have a WIP
advanced search form that will replace all the current listing. This
will allow everyone to do advanced research. You can play with it here:

Many thanks to [Yohan](https://twitter.com/informagicien) for this great
work!

Spreading the word
------------------

Bram did a lot to spread the word : he did two presentations about
Memopol, at the FNF2012 (Freedom Not Fear) and at the SFD2012 (Software
Freedom Day).

You can see them here :

One last thing
--------------

Memopol will be one of the projects we'll work on at the Quadrature
Communication Camp that will occur in Paris the 19th to the 21st of
october. If you want to code all night long for the project, design it,
and --of course-- have fun, please come over ! →
