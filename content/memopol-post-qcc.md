Hello!

We come with great news!

The QCC : a starting block.
---------------------------

You know that we were at the QCC from the october, 19th, to the 21th. It
was good to be all of us, at the same time, at the same place, to work
on Memopol. A lot of things were done this weekend. Bram and Ybon,
mostly, are finishing the work.

The design is almost integrated in dev. We keep working on the new
scoring for the MEPs, we are importing assistants in the database,
adding achievements, de-projectifying memopol, fixing public positions
and working on adopting our new standard for representatives.

We can say that this weekend was kind of a « starting block » : we could
unite the right people at the right moment and place, and this made the
project reboot : more people are involved in Memopol now, a lot of
things that were blocking us are now solved too and helped us to keep on
moving.

We went to Barcelona in this state of mind.

Barcelona loves Memopol (and we love Barcelona)
-----------------------------------------------

Some people from La Quadrature were at the[FC
Forum ](http://2012.fcforum.net/en) in Barcelona. This event is made for
hackers and artists to help building a world less censored, with more
free culture and open knowledge. We presented Memopol there and it
occured that some Spanish hacktivists wanted to add their parliament to
Memopol!

So we are working with them --now that we have a « Memopol core »
version that can be adapted for any project, to make this Spanish
memopol work.  
You will soon be able to see the first result of this team work.
¡*Gracias* to Anders, Coldwind, Pablog, and the ones we forgot!

We are glad to see this happening : this was part of the aim of this
project, letting every organisation using their own Memopol for their
causes.

So so so?
---------

The new design will be soon presented to you so that you'll see how hard
we worked to have a better app for activists, and, sure, there's still a
lot to do :)
