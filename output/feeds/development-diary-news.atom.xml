A lot of work has been
done lately to make it more friendly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is made real because people are here, taking care of the project,
building it, maintaining it. And, as we want Memopol to be spread
everywhere, to be powerful, to be better and better, we need people to
help us achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, here the thing :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a tremendously useful tool, Memopol, and we have a bunch of
organisations starving for a practical way to collect data from their
parliament(s).&lt;br /&gt;
At the moment, Memopol is very much designed for La Quadrature du Net's
purpose. That's why it is now so shinny and relevant... for us. But, it
is not what other organisations are looking for. Organisations fighting
for spreading farmer seeds want relevant data on last votes about food
processing or agriculture, French organisations on transparency need
data from the French Parliament etc.&lt;br /&gt;
La Quadrature du Net doesn't have nor time nor ressources nor interest
to provide all of those data. It is then these organisations'
responsibility to deal with this job. Though, it doesn't mean we can't
help them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the aim of this post: part of the Memopol current team
volunteered to make this fantastic tool transferrable for other use than
the fight for fundamental freedoms online. But we need more people ready
to get dirty in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;We are looking for :&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;django developper (most important for the moment)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;front end developpers (we aren't using any specific framework, just
    jquery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;webdesigners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;people who like to play with data and make datavisualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know a lot of organisations are interested in Memopol, but often,
they don't have the skills yet to use it. It would be great if we could
"package" it, making it really easy to handle and then spread it among
the world. We would see dozens of little Memopol growing up all around
the Internetz and making thousands of happy activists call and track
their representatives. That's how we spread datalove&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably know that the whole Memopol team is here at the #QCC to
work on the tool. Being reunited all together in the same place, at the
same time, gives us the energy necessary to reach our goal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A5leoUdCIAIcqwS.jpg" title="Mate, fuel of the event" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick summary of what we achieved over the week-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Bram, the new &lt;strong&gt;scoring&lt;/strong&gt; system is ready at the backend
level. It should be &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more logical and easy to understand: Members
of the EP now start at 0, and they gain or lose points with each vote.
This will be integrated after the new design is ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan has started to work on adapting the charts to the new scoring
system, he will send us the results of his work during the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some work has also been done on &lt;strong&gt;translating&lt;/strong&gt;, most notably on charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capslock has progessed in the implementation of &lt;strong&gt;public positions.&lt;/strong&gt; It
will allow us to add &lt;strong&gt;press articles&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;quotations&lt;/strong&gt; regarding a
representative to track his/her public position on our subjects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarnefys is working on importing &lt;strong&gt;Members of the EP's assistants&lt;/strong&gt; from
&lt;a href="http://parltrack.euwiki.org/"&gt;Parltrack&lt;/a&gt;, which will provide us with
useful campaigning information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zorun and Gawel have been working on an &lt;strong&gt;achievement&lt;/strong&gt; system to
attribute trophies to MEPs: the backend implementation is mostly ready.
An &lt;strong&gt;achievement&lt;/strong&gt; can be either positive or negative, and represents
subjective data on a MEP, for instance "&lt;em&gt;ACTA killer"&lt;/em&gt;, "&lt;em&gt;top 10
score"&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; "most abstentionist MEP"&lt;/em&gt;, "&lt;em&gt;has signed amendments on Net
Neutrality"&lt;/em&gt;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stef fixed the &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; of Europe for &lt;a href="http://respectmynet.eu/list/"&gt;Respect My
Net&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/"&gt;Memopol&lt;/a&gt;: the maps were really slow to
display, so he optimized them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ybon helped both teams and allowed us to communicate smoothly. He fixed
a funny bug with the &lt;strong&gt;search&lt;/strong&gt; system: we couldn't understand why
searching for countries like Belgium (BE) and Austria (AT) didn't work.
The reason is that "BE" and "AT" were taken as separator words by Woosh,
our searching framework… You can look at &lt;a href="http://gitorious.org/memopol2-0/memopol2-0/commit/fb2314fa92a49b595d64a35363dd3611db2c1e23"&gt;the commit fixing
this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the design side, we (currently Ybon and myself) warmly welcomed
Serguei, who helped us &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; \o/ For instance, I drafted some HTML
that he then integrated on the templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If everything works well, we'll have our &lt;strong&gt;beta-design&lt;/strong&gt; by Sunday
night!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, a lot has been done. We'll come back to you pretty soon
with what was finally achieved and pushed to production and also what's
planned next!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What's new on Memopol ? #3</title><link href="http://www.memopol.org/whats-new-on-memopol-3.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-27T09:01:00+02:00</updated><author><name>quota_atypique</name></author><id>tag:www.memopol.org,2012-06-27:whats-new-on-memopol-3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hey, long time we haven't met! And by coincidence we have
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_D_Z-D2tzi14/S8TRIo4br3I/AAAAAAAACv4/Zh7_GcMlRKo/s1600/ALOT.png"&gt;alot&lt;/a&gt;
of exciting news!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A nicer and nicer Memopol&lt;strong&gt;full of datalove!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know we want Memopol to be beautiful. We've worked on it and we now
have finished the display of the opinions! Here is an
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/europe/parliament/opinion/4009/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;,
another
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/europe/parliament/opinion/3949/"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, and
a &lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/europe/parliament/opinion/3977/"&gt;third
example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Elections? Oh wait /o/&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You probably heard about the french elections in june…Which means update
for memopol on the french deputies' side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we made various fixes on french deputies pages, there is still more
work needed, we also use the new nosdeputes.fr widget (&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/france/assemblee/depute/PatriciaAdam/"&gt;example
here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we are now working on importing the new deputies in Memopol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition we now have custom pages for french votes (&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/france/assemblee/vote/Vote_final_loi_Hadopi/"&gt;for
eg&lt;/a&gt;)
and are planning on displaying more informations on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Another big project&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of memopol we want to allow people to do custom
queries on our dataset and we recently made some progress, you can play
with our &lt;em&gt;prototype&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/europe/parliament/query/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Datalove without borders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="magicdomid86"&gt;
Memopol is made to bring your elected representatives closer to you. We
are working on translations to bring it even closer to you : in your own
language \\o/

&lt;/p&gt;
Spanish and deutch translations have begun, you can contribute
[here](https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/), just ask to join
a team and we'll validate you asap.

Speaking about translations, we made also various fix in translation
part!

Code, code code
---------------

On the developement side, you'll notice that we have working system
tests again!

We are exploring continuous integration with travis but we still have a
problem of path to run the tests. You can see it
[here](http://travis-ci.org/#/Psycojoker/memopol2).

Other details
-------------

Eurodeputies' opinions ' moderation should be faster now, we have
upgraded it.

On the (modest) SEO side, we have assured ourself on having custom
\&lt;title\&gt; everywhere!

Also, we added the possibility to edit a zone on top of the right menu
for jz (kudos to him, he managed to break the whole menu by not closing
a \&lt;/a\&gt; tag while using his new toy :p).

…And of course, a lot of small bugix, cleaning in trends code by bouska,
and we can welcome 2 patchs by 2 new contributors:
[koolfy](http://koolfy.be/) and rogdham, kudos to both of them \\o/.
Thanks to you, and welcome, guys \\o/

&lt;h3&gt;Memopol, prettier for the summer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, let us introduce you to our brand new logo! \o/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="logo" src="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/static/img/logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is on prod, and as we warned you last time, it has been modified a
bit to be more parliament-like. Now it won't change and we're quite
proud of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's all thank Alban for this great work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great news with pictures : please check the new very nice map on
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/"&gt;the homepage!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memopol-map.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="map" src="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/memopol-map-300x282.png" title="memopol-map" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice, isn't it ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Documentation, moar documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we have published documentation that explains how to read the
graphs that we use in Memopol to allow you to have a better vision of
what has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see it here →
&lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/trends/documentation/"&gt;https://memopol.lqdn.fr/trends/documentation/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Rest API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news everyone! Memopol now offers most of its data via a Rest API
so you can build applications related to it! You can find all the
informations in the &lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/api/"&gt;related documentation
page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't hesitate in giving us feedback and to build awesome things with
it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Feeding Memopol with data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the data side, we retrieved opinions from memopol1, this allows us to
distinguish between French deputies' opinions and eurodeputies'
opinions, this informations was lost in the previous data importation.
For French deputies' opinions, correct interfaces to display data are
still needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step now is to make a better interface to display them. We want
you to get the most of it, opinions beeing a very important part of
Memopol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Memopol now speak French!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have just finished the translation of the interface! Thanks to our
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/fr/"&gt;awesome french
team&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You still might see text in english there and there, this is because
it's dynamic data either coming from parltrack or from our project, this
will need further work to tacle it but we'll sure handle it one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, we have just created teams on transifex to translate Memopol in
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/nl/"&gt;Dutch&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/de/"&gt;German&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/hu/"&gt;Hungarian&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/it/"&gt;Italian&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/pl/"&gt;Polish&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/es/"&gt;Spanish&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/memopol2/language/sv/"&gt;Swedish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I you feel confident in any of those languages don't hesitate to ask to
join a team on transifex and if you want to see Memopol translated in
another language don't hesitate to &lt;a href="https://memopol.lqdn.fr/contact/"&gt;contact
us&lt;/a&gt; about that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;As we love Memopol, we chase bugs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To insure that we can fix bugs as soon as they appear, we have deployed
a &lt;a href="https://github.com/dcramer/sentry"&gt;sentry&lt;/a&gt; to get a detailed repport
each time a new bug shows up! It has already been useful, as we have
already found and fixed bugs thanks to this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also fixed the csv link that was'nt working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We fixed other minor bugs -we won't bother you with the list, but be
sure that we take care of Memopol!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's it for this post \o/&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What's new on memopol dev n°0</title><link href="http://www.memopol.org/whats-new-on-memopol-dev-n0.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-30T20:11:00+02:00</updated><author><name>bram</name></author><id>tag:www.memopol.org,2012-04-30:whats-new-on-memopol-dev-n0.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, this is the beginning of a series of development diaries
to report on the progress of our project!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Latest improvements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As part of the latest improvements we have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great patch by new contributors: &lt;a href=""&gt;emel&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://marmelune.net"&gt;benoitb&lt;/a&gt;. They have managed to reduce the
incredibly high number of queries on every page where we list european
deputies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now eurpdeputies' score is displayed in the listings, so you'll see in a
quick look how net-neutrality friendly your deputy is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;See, notes are colorized from red to green depending on the value of
the score :&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/memopol-notes.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/memopol-notes-300x116.png" title="memopol-notes" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we can make .csv exports ! Which is great, if you want to download
the data and have it in your favourite spreadsheets editor. This can
help to prepare talks, or to play with the data a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;See (it's on the top right of every list) :&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/memopol-csv.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.memopol.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/memopol-csv-300x107.jpg" title="memopol-csv" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important piece of news: the whole European Parliament website
has changed. This is both good and bad news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good news, because this new version offers some new information and is
better overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news, we have less data now, especially the previous commitment of a
deputy in a commitee, delegation or mandate, and the starting date of
the current commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News about the design ! We're working on it :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memopol is still &lt;a href="http://www.memopol.org/faq/" title="FAQ (en)"&gt;looking for more
